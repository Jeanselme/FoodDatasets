	"Limitations": ["Usual limitations of tweet: is it really reflective of habits (weekly in this dataset), selection bias, difference of tweets behavior given region", "Use #problemoffat is perhaps not nly used by obese people", "Use of model based on mean to predict personal risk: the use of image recognition to estimate the weight could enhance results)"],

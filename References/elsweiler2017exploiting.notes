	"Summary": "This article proposes approached to show in a food recommender system similar recipes with less fat options.",
	"Conclusions": ["Users have a hard time to guess from images which recipe is less fat.", "Users tends to prefer nicer images", "Users are impacted by popularity"],
	"Limitations": ["Definition of healthy as fat content is biased", "Fat per serving is also a bad idea in the sense that serving is badly defined (a caloric density would be better)", "Taking also the fiber density would be great", "Influencing the choice by enhancing the images (as Netflix does) would be an interesting point to nudge people towards healthier recipes"],
	"Tags": ["Cuisine", "Eating", "Recommender"]

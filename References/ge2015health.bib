  abstract = {With the rapid changes in the food variety and lifestyles, many people are facing the problem of making healthier food decisions to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. To this end, our recommender system not only offers recipe recommendations that suit the user's preference but is also able to take the user's health into account. It is developed on a mobile platform by considering that our application may be directly used in the kitchen. This demo paper summarizes the complete human-computer interaction design, the implemented health-aware recommendation algorithm and preliminary user feedback.}

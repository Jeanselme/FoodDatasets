#### Abstract
> To complement traditional dietary surveys, which are costly and of limited scale, researchers have resorted to digital data to infer the impact of eating habits on people's health. However, online studies are limited in resolution: they are carried out at country or regional level and do not capture precisely the composition of the food consumed. We study the association between food consumption (derived from the loyalty cards of the main grocery retailer in London) and health outcomes (derived from publicly-available medical prescription records of all general practitioners in the city). The scale and granularity of our analysis is unprecedented: we analyze 1.6B food item purchases and 1.1B medical prescriptions for the entire city of London over the course of one year. By studying food consumption down to the level of nutrients, we show that nutrient diversity and amount of calories are the two strongest predictors of the prevalence of three diseases related to what is called the 'metabolic syndrome': hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes. This syndrome is a cluster of symptoms generally associated with obesity, is common across the rich world, and affects one in four adults in the UK. Our linear regression models achieve an R^2 of 0.6 when estimating the prevalence of diabetes in nearly 1000 census areas in London, and a classifier can identify (un)healthy areas with up to 91% accuracy. Interestingly, healthy areas are not necessarily well-off (income matters less than what one would expect) and have distinctive features: they tend to systematically eat less carbohydrates and sugar, diversify nutrients, and avoid large quantities. More generally, our study shows that analytics of digital records of grocery purchases can be used as a cheap and scalable tool for health surveillance and, upon these records, different stakeholders from governments to insurance companies to food companies could implement effective prevention strategies.

#### Summary
This article uses grocery store data and medical prescriptions to analyze the impact of food on metabolic syndrom in London.

#### Conclusions
- Socio economic conditons impacts less than nutritions
- Eating less and diverse nutrients is linked to better health conditions
- Calorie concentration is more important than calorie consumption

#### Limitations
- Selection bias: population are limited to a grocery and only people with loyalty card are concerned
- No causal explanation

### <a name='2'></a> \[2\] [The Spread of Obesity in a Large Social Network over 32 Years](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsa066082) 

by Christakis, Nicholas A. and Fowler, James H.
 in 2007

#### Abstract
> BACKGROUND
>The prevalence of obesity has increased substantially over the past 30 years. We performed a quantitative analysis of the nature and extent of the person-to-person spread of obesity as a possible factor contributing to the obesity epidemic.
>
>METHODS
>We evaluated a densely interconnected social network of 12,067 people assessed repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. The body-mass index was available for all subjects. We used longitudinal statistical models to examine whether weight gain in one person was associated with weight gain in his or her friends, siblings, spouse, and neighbors.
>
>RESULTS
>Discernible clusters of obese persons (body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], >=30) were present in the network at all time points, and the clusters extended to three degrees of separation. These clusters did not appear to be solely attributable to the selective formation of social ties among obese persons. A person's chances of becoming obese increased by 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 123) if he or she had a friend who became obese in a given interval. Among pairs of adult siblings, if one sibling became obese, the chance that the other would become obese increased by 40% (95% CI, 21 to 60). If one spouse became obese, the likelihood that the other spouse would become obese increased by 37% (95% CI, 7 to 73). These effects were not seen among neighbors in the immediate geographic location. Persons of the same sex had relatively greater influence on each other than those of the opposite sex. The spread of smoking cessation did not account for the spread of obesity in the network.
>
>CONCLUSIONS
>Network phenomena appear to be relevant to the biologic and behavioral trait of obesity, and obesity appears to spread through social ties. These findings have implications for clinical and public health interventions.

#### Summary
This article analyses the spread of obesity through the relations network.

#### Conclusions
- Significant increase of obesity if friends or siblings became obese (3 degree)
- Social link more important than geographical distance

#### Limitations
- Is there a selection bias from the population selected (only from Framingham Offspring Study - How have they been chosen ? Location, Class ...)
- Is there an impact if people are more obses (not taking obese as a binary but take the value of BMI into account)
- Is the density of the network impacting the gain of weight ?
- Is the opposite also true ?

### <a name='3'></a> \[3\] [Ice cream illusions: bowls, spoons, and self-served portion sizes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16905035) 

by Wansink, Brian and Van Ittersum, Koert and Painter, James E
 in 2006

#### Abstract
> BACKGROUND:
>Because people eat most of what they serve themselves, any contextual cues that lead them to over-serve should lead them to over-eat. In building on the size-contrast illusion, this research examines whether the size of a bowl or serving spoon unknowingly biases how much a person serves and eats.    
>
>METHODS:
>The 2 x 2 between-subjects design involved 85 nutrition experts who were attending an ice cream social to celebrate the success of a colleague in 2002. They were randomly given either a smaller (17 oz) or a larger (34 oz) bowl and either a smaller (2 oz) or larger (3 oz) ice cream scoop. After serving themselves, they completed a brief survey as their ice cream was weighed. The analysis was conducted in 2003.
>
>RESULTS:
>Even when nutrition experts were given a larger bowl, they served themselves 31.0% more (6.25 vs 4.77 oz, F(1, 80) = 8.05, p < 0.01) without being aware of it. Their servings increased by 14.5% when they were given a larger serving spoon (5.77 vs 5.04 oz, F(1, 80)=2.70, p = 0.10).
>
>CONCLUSIONS:
>People could try using the size of their bowls and possibly serving spoons to help them better control how much they consume. Those interested in losing weight should use smaller bowls and spoons, while those needing to gain weight--such as the undernourished or aged--could be encouraged to use larger ones. Epidemiologic implications are discussed.

#### Summary
This article shows the impact of plate and ustensils size on the food consumption.

#### Conclusions
- Larger is the plate, more people eat
- People are not aware of this difference of portion size
- Calorie concentration is more important than calorie consumption

#### Limitations
- Does it depend of the population ?
- Is the impact opposite for anorexic or obese patients ?

### <a name='4'></a> \[4\] [Crowdsourcing health labels: Inferring body weight from profile pictures](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2897727) 

by Weber, Ingmar and Mejova, Yelena
 in 2016

#### Abstract
> To use social media for health-related analysis, one key step is the detection of health-related labels for users. But unlike transient conditions like flu, social media users are less vocal about chronic conditions such as obesity, as users might not tweet ``I'm still overweight''. As, however, obesity-related conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, osteoarthritis, and even cancer are on the rise, this obese-or-not label could be one of the most useful for studies in public health.
>In this paper we investigate the feasibility of using profile pictures to infer if a user is overweight or not. We show that this is indeed possible and further show that the fraction of labeled-as-overweight users is higher in U.S. counties with higher obesity rates. Going from public to individual health analysis, we then find differences both in behavior and social networks, for example finding users labeled as overweight to have fewer followers.

#### Summary
This article asks a crowdsource to evaluate if twitter users are overweighted based on their profile picture.

#### Limitations
- No ground truth
- Only 3 persons who evaluates and conclusion made on their consensus correlated to the number of obese in different counties
- Models should be built to predict the label obtained
- Vocabulary used in the tweet should be studied in a discriminative fashiion, to evaluate what is characteristic of each group.
